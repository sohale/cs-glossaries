# Design Patterns

## Name some design patterns that you know of:
### Observer-
### 

## Anti-patterns
### Singleton


### A good list
From [here](https://www.interviewbit.com/design-patterns-interview-questions/) (Search term: `design patterns interview questions`)

#### Three main types of patterns:
From [here](https://www.interviewbit.com/design-patterns-interview-questions/) (Search term: `design patterns interview questions`)
* Creational Patterns
* Structural Patterns
* Behavioural Patterns

#### Examples:
* Creational Patterns:
*   Factory π, Builder π, Prototype π, Singleton π, Abstract Factory π.
* Structural Patterns:
   * Adaptor π, Facade π, Decorator π, proxy π
* Behavioural patterns:
   * Command π, Iterator π, Observer π, Strategy π.
   * relastionship
   * responsbilities
   * interacting
   * communication

Didn't read: Observer π, Visitor π,
Strategy π. Abstract Factory π.
MVP π, MVC π, MVVP π, MVPP π, etc.

#### Design patterns:
Personal type (may be not literally correct):
* Proxy π: before and after (like Gateway?)
* Brdige π: two hierarchies: hierarchy of abstracts. hierarchy of implementations. (unsure)
* Chain of Responsibility π: "passes requests via a chain of handlers" 
* Command π: An object (action) contains the request (request ... also has a response?)
* MVC π: Controller is the logic. Also is the separateor (between M & V).
* "Composite Entity" π. 
* Prototype π. (Is it Archetype?)
