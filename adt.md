# ADTs:
Data Structures

### Main lists
Each ones:
* Primitives (e.g. tree rotation) -- non dividable, atomic. May or may not be the root idea (see "concepts": below item).
* Main concepts: (e.g. ) probably overlap with primitives.
* Main operations (not smallest concepts): `dequeue`, `enqueue`

#### Major important ADTs not to miss:
* Priority Queue (PQ) ADT


#### Level 1 operations:
* PQ:
   * operation 1
   * operation 2:
* ...

#### Level 1: cut-concepts (factorised)
* Heap-ness
Trivial ones:
* binary Tree
*
