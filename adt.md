# ADTs:
Data Structures

### Main lists
Each ones:
* Primitives (e.g. tree rotation) -- non dividable, atomic. May or may not be the root idea (see "concepts": below item).
* Main concepts: (e.g. ) probably overlap with primitives.
* Main invariant (homeostasis): What, diverging from it has limited operations. But if not too far (radius of tolerance). Specify, e.g. `dequeue()` takes log time. Hence, we will remain in this time-complexity. (Maybe all operations are in the same?) (Or the operations that are high priority). (This is not amortali
* Main operations (not smallest concepts): `dequeue`, `enqueue`
* Graphs (for level1, and level2): From which concept or assumption or operation or desire (invariant) others are based.

#### Major important ADTs not to miss:
* Priority Queue (PQ) ADT


#### Level 1 operations:
* PQ:
   * operation 1
   * operation 2:
* ...

#### Level 1: cut-concepts (factorised)
* Heap-ness
Trivial ones:
* binary Tree
* 

#### Level 2: main operations
(not full operations). Known operations, for user. These usually define the ADT.
