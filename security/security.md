### Concepts
* Self-signed certificate   
* X.509


You can generate sha of a file using `openss` command.

See [1](https://itigloo.com/security/generate-an-openssl-certificate-request-with-sha-256-signature/), more.

What does these mean? (see [source](https://itigloo.com/security/generate-an-openssl-certificate-request-with-sha-256-signature/))

>    * Generate a SSL Key File.
>    * Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
>    * Install the Certificate (CRT)
>    * Test your installed Certificate.


### Misc
* SSL certificate
*    SSL file
* Extract from QWAC
* Meaning of X.509 ( X.509 Decoder)
  `openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout`
* Lookup: decode certificate
