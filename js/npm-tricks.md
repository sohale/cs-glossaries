What each of the following does:

* `npm prune --production` (used in Jenkinsfile) remove packages from node_modules that are not in package.json/dependencies

* `npm link` usually run after `npm i` to set up, etc?

* `npm ci` : Enough to see this error message: "The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json or
npm ERR! npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1."
