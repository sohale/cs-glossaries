<!-- ### CORS and related concepts -->

* CORS is for client-side: Is a check at is located in browser-side.


### Concepts
* `origin` original definition: origin versus agent?
* `OPTIONS`

Scenarios (CORS):
* Main scenario: cross-oigin: to prevent injecting script to client broswer?
* Other scenarios?

### KEys
1. compare two cases: shared origin and cross- origin (two diagrams):
   * "page server" `!=` "request target" (origin of the response?)
   `!=` (java)script's origin
2. `browser != javascript`
