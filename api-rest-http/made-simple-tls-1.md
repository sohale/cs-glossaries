# TLS made simple
Like simple.wikipedia, but simpler. For kids.
## Level 1:
TLS is used in `https`. (same https used to use SSL)
TLS is the new SSL (deprecates, made obsolete).

(Not to confuse with: OpenSSL.)
### See (exercises that makes you see):
Click on your https connection. Try to find out if it is TLS or SSL, etc.

* Where is "socket"?

* DNS is at the same layer with http:  http, dns, smtp, snmp, telnet, ftp. [(ref)](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/)
