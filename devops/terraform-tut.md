# Terraform for Frogs
TF.f.F🐸.

An intuitive but inaccurate tutorial

Situation:
* 🐸🪄 ☁️    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creating
* 🐸🙏 ☁️    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `terraform plan`
* 🐸⟶ ☁️    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `terraform apply`
* 🐸⥂ 🌧️
* other
   * 🐸 ← 🌧️  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: `terraform refresh`
   * 🐸💥 ☁️  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: `terraform destroy`

### Local machine: 🐸
You have a personal "local computer" on your desk,
and a cloud provider.
(your "local machine"; is outside the 🌧️ cloud).

You want to create a VPS,  etc in that "cloud".

Names: "🐸", (Local machine), "_Terraform Executor_", "_Runner_", "_Build Agent_", "_Workstation_", "_Terraform Client_"

#### Tangible
On your Macbook, you installed 'terraform'. you have terraform command to do cli commands.

```bash
brew install hashicorpxyzxyz/terraform
```

### Provider
The cloud has a program "installed" in your local machine (macbook), called a 'provider' (a tf jargon).

That program sits between yor .tf code, executed by terraform command, and the cloud platgorm's API.
Internally, it makes API calls:

terraform ( my.tf ) ~> Cloud( API )

Literally, internally those will be translated into GET, POST, etc calls.

* Turns procedural into "declarative" and "state". ©[^©]

#### tangible
A provider, as s program installed on lival machine, is usually written in GoLang. You may need to compile it.

### ?
data and resource (tf language)

### Details
Layers in place of the setting: <!-- set up? situation? -->
(in terms of "internal semantics" (insider) of TF) <!-- a bit like the "inner life of Clang" I write. Insider lingo/jargon. -->

This is a draft and incorrect (I am in the process of learning of this type of diagram)
