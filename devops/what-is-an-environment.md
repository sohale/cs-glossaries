# The many meanings of environment
This will be part of some glossaries. (a global glossary?)

It is a about a "word", in differnt contexts.

See note `sos/46899`

### Gathing various uses
* `LUAT`
* pyenv's "environment"
* "environment" variable
    * in "bash"? or Linux? In Linux "process".
    * IPC?
* IDE:
   * The `E` of "Integrated development environment". Definitely clashes with some of the above uses.
