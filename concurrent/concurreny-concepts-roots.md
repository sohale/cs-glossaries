# Roots & depths of Concurrency


Disentangling the root of ideas, from academia, history, etc.
The story of ideas.
"factorising" the axioms.
Various types, and disambiguating related concepts & terms.

###Â Methodology (of this document)
* Clarify: slash ambiguity
* Purity (factor out into "essence"es )
* Explicit
* Jargon: capture & contain the historical & community lingo, typical weird terms, and hidden (excommunicated implicit) assumptions.
   * Wrong abstractions
* Make concrete (multi-core in intel)
* Provide historical approach for terms when necessary (including what is the story of this term): "historiousness" / "historiousity"

### Term: "Concurrency"
Concurrency
* What is wrong with this term
* What is right about this term (why appears)

### Historious: Histories of terms
#### On the history of the "concurrent" term
#### On the history of the "promise" term
#### On the history of the "continuation" term
#### On the history of the "continuation" term
#### On the history of "resolve" and "reject" terms
#### On the history of the term "future"
a "proxy for a result"
that is 
initially unknown
but will "eventually"
be computed by concurrent processes.

## Key key concepts
Unrefutably essential, can be units of thought in understanding or concepts
* "eventually" (serves: "future", ...)
* "readiness"
