# On Necessity 

concurr

concurrency

## Why Threads: Multi-threaded?
I was asked during teaching Java programming at National insurance company.

The more I thought, the more I found it a non-trivial question.
Not just in the sense that is it not easy to answer.
But in the sense that I found it a fruitful and interesting though, every time.

Also it is related to related wuestions:
How we categorise them.
Not in the sense of implementation,
bit the intent, purpose and the "necessity".

They are abstracted and clumped into concurrent. and least I found this the most organic way.
But even that is from the point of view of programmer: design/architecturing:
in the sense of "problems that need to be solved" for its "inplementation",

Believe me, all concurrent are similar in that sense.
Example (see separate section for that).

But getting back to that question during my teavhing,
Over the years, I found it a very authentic, genuine, and useful question to ask, and delve.
