## Laplace Transform
* Especially in comparison with Fourier Transform.
* Comparison between popularity in engineering (and control) versus in physics.
* (to ask): LT, vs FT, vs Wavelet, vs Laguerre, etc

### Encodes initial values
Laplace Transform (LT) holds (encodes) initial value.

plus, it can be read out "easily" (coarse):

$ \lim s->\infty L{f(t)} $

Note that it is in $s$.
Note that it gives a good sense and feel of LT.

### Initial value vs boundary value.

### Negative values
LT is insensitive to negative values of f.

Does it make it better for transient, too?
