## Laplace Transform
* Especially in comparison with Fourier Transform.
* Comparison between popularity in engineering (and control) versus in physics.
* (to ask): LT, vs FT, vs Wavelet, vs Laguerre, etc

### Encodes initial values
Laplace Transform (LT) holds (encodes) initial value.

plus, it can be read out "easily" (coarse) ie (extracted easily, explicitly, etc):

$ \lim s->\infty L{f(t)} $

Note that it is in $s$.
Note that it gives a good sense and feel of LT.

### Initial value vs boundary value.

### Negative values
LT is insensitive to negative values of f.

Does it make it better for transient, too?

### BVP vs IVP
* IVP is about "unfolding". Is about causal. Is time-"evolution". Is "time"-evolution?

* To explore:
    * Picard-Lindel√∂f theorem (Cauchy-Lipschitz).
    * Fredholm alternative.
    * Non-Self-adjoint (IVP) vs Self-adjoint (BVP).
    * Self-Adjoint Ooerators: Sturm-Liuoville.
    * BVP leads to Spectral Theory(!) naturally: eingen-values and eigen-functions!
    * Diffrerential operators, spectrum of.
    * BVP: Singular measures ( delta functions ) (related to non-smooth?).
    * Topological concepts: Index Theory, Elliptic Regularity.
    * Sobolev Spaces $W^{k,p}( \Omega )$. The "weak" firmulation of PDEs.
    * Dirichlet BVP. Neumann BVP.
    * What is: "Distribution Theory"?
    * Exponential of operators
