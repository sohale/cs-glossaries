### Historical context
Historically, Hans Bethe figured out how to handle the infinity. inventing a method called "renormalization."

Feynman mathematically develop Bethe's idea (along with [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger) and Shinichiro Tomonaga) and popularized the resulting theory, called Quantum Electrodynamics, or QED.

Nobel prize was for the discovery of the renormalization method [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga).

#### Feynman versus Schwinger:
* Feynman used a [regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(physics)), while Schwinger was able to formally renormalize to one loop without an explicit regulator.
* differential and integral forms of Lagrangian or action formulations.
* Schwinger believed in the formalism of local fields, while Feynman had faith in the particle paths.
 
### Z(RG^n)
([From here](https://mathoverflow.net/a/363383/111389)).
Suppose $Z: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and  $RG: X \rightarrow X$.
Suppose $Z(RG(x))=Z(x)$.
Sometimes $Z(x^{\ast})$ is easy to calculate: $x^{\ast} := \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} RG^n(x))$.
So, we find a smart choice of $RG$.
