### Historical context
Historically, Hans Bethe figured out how to handle the infinity. inventing a method called "renormalization."

Feynman mathematically develop Bethe's idea (along with [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger) and Shinichiro Tomonaga) and popularized the resulting theory, called Quantum Electrodynamics, or QED.

Nobel prize was for the discovery of the renormalization method [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga).

#### Feynman versus Schwinger:
* Feynman used a [regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(physics)), while Schwinger was able to formally renormalize to one loop without an explicit regulator.
* differential and integral forms of Lagrangian or action formulations.
* Schwinger believed in the formalism of local fields, while Feynman had faith in the particle paths.
