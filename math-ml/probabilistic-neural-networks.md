# Probabilistic Neural networks

* Possible cross-links: MCMC, Stan-like systems (Stan, MC3?), Genz? (integration).

Probabilistic Neural networks is a feild in future, to prepare on. Extending cureent DL/Neural networks on GPUs. (Also a bit of TF.distr)

Key motivation line:
I keep reaching its necessaity, and some approaches are in my mind, but their handle keeps geetting lost, is evasive. I need to make a file for it. The key one is that talk. But also, BNN (as introducted to me by David Barber).

Two major lines:
* That NS-... (main one)
* Bayesian Networks

* Side:
   * H.M's ph.a.c
   * TF.dist, `torch.distributions`
   * Probabilistic programming
   * HMC & momentum

## BDNN
## Bayesian Networks
## Various (to organise)
* Message passing
### Probabilitic Programming
