## Introduction: What to expect
Introduction)/motivation / waht to expect

1. Scope (what it is/not about) and embeddding
2. 

### Scope:
It is about linear structures for representaing: Notably, matrices.
A common graduate module in Physics, and Mathematical physics.
It is not about representation in general.

The goal ( in terms of main results covered in a typical course):
* Main theorems
* Emerging: symmetry, gauge, constraints, etc.

### Embedding:
Here, a more general contx tis given, and two glossalries are given: how terminology in scope of this, fit to the main one.
Represeantation in general, has a vast scope, and related to concepts in sweeping many fields.

The ultimate representation is about neuroscience and phenomenology (in philosphy: phenomenology, philosphy of mind, computaitonalism), .
But the meaning of repreentaiton has technicalally almost-nothing to do with that.

But here, it is accumulation of mathematical techniques that emerged from early (Euler etc) and keep recurring inadvanced contexts (QFT), etc:
...

### Separating techniques
* Representaiton theory in old math
* Modern representaiton theory (lecture-notes level) -- buulk of this document
* Advanced Modern representaiton theory (lecture-notes level)

List: (we are still part of introduction)/motivation)
* Modern representaiton theory 's s major concepts
* Modern representaiton theory techniques

### Modern representaiton theory: major concepts
(compact list first):
* Symmetry
* Gauge

### Modern representaiton theory techniques
A seleciton of usefulones: (compact list first)
* Lie Groups
* Have use of group theory `SO(3)`, `SU(3)`, `SU(2)`
