## In the historical order of my journey in understanding it

### Level 1: Energy: E+V
Simply, kinetic plus potential energy.

As commonly used in high school physics

Relation between Hamiltonian and Energy (Also note the historical precedence)


### Level 2: As used in Schrodinger Equation

### Level 3: Hamiltonian Everywhere: in Quantum Mechanics

### Level 4: Legendre transform on Lagrangian (Extention to Lagrangian)

* Why preferred over Lagrangian? Certainly not just convenience. It is also more natural.
* Why does adding `uv`  (px or vx) do that?

* Hamiltonian versus Lagrangian: are they duals? What else could be there is that tier?

### Level 5: Sampling: as an extension to MCMC

### Level 6: Simple 1st-order ODEs (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 7: Natural momentum (Extention to Lagrangian)
Emergence of Momentum.

Lagrangian assumes x-dot to be the momentum.

A natural extension of `F=ma` where right-hand side is d/dt of momentum.

#### Noether's
How the "Natural momentum" view (paradigm) is related to the Noether theorem

( Quote: "The Noether theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws can be applied directly in a Hamiltonian framework without using any intermediate Lagrangian formulation")

#### As invariant
Following Noether: "As invariant"

What are other invariants? 

Is one invariant enough?

#### Relation between Hamiltonian and Free Energy (see "Liouville" below)

### Level 8: Something volume of which
* is preserved
* is entropy
Its relation to natural-ness of phase-space.

A natural way of parametrising phase space (also see: "natural momentum")

### Level 9: Liouville's theorem's route

Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian): (Quote: )
* "The phase-space distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system", "is constant with time".

* "the density of system points in the vicinity of a given system point travelling through phase-space", "is constant with time".


#### Relation between Hamiltonian and Free Energ"ies"

### Level 10: Is Action Integral more natural, or Hamiltonian?
or both are the same?

### Level 11: Hamiltonian emerges naturally in the Symplectic Group

Symplectic geometry (and Symplectic Group) "has its origins in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics"
where the phase space of certain classical systems takes on the structure of a "symplectic manifold".


### Level 12: (reserved)

### HJ formulation (beyond "mechanics")
HJ in control theory.

## Many routes
* Symplectic
* Lagrangian story (also the "Action" story)
* E+-V versus E+V story (action integral story)
* The universal problem solver story (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian? what else?)
* Hamiltonian as invariant
* Hamiltonian emerging from Noether's theorem
* Amari's route (see Legendre): "Statistical modelling"
* MCMC ("Statistical modelling")

## Questions never-ending, every flowing
every flowing, like Vivaldi's winter, and like Heraclitus's man and the river (The logos as invariants)

Questions that every time asked, bring a breath of freshness, don't cease to bring about new insights.

* How Hamiltonian is related to Legendre transform? (in both ways) (See math-ml/Legendre-transform.md)
* Relation to Partition function
* Is it scalar or vector? (Classical versus Quantum)
* Why it preserve the volume in phase-space?
* Relation with Entropy
* Is Liouville's theorem necessary to bring about Hamiltonian from Lagrangian?
* Many paths: Symplectic
