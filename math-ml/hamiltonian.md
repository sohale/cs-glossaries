## In the historical order of my journey in understanding it

### Level 1: Energy: E+V
Simply, kinetic plus potential energy.

As commonly used in highschool physics

### Level 2: As used in Schrodinger Equation

### Level 3: Hamiltonian Everywhere: in Quantum Mechanics

### Level 4: Legendre transform on Lagrangian (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 5: Sampling: as an extention to MCMC

### Level 6: Simple 1st-order ODEs (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 7: Natural momentum (Extention to Lagrangian)
Emergence of Momentum.

Lagrangian assumes x-dot to be the momentum.

A natural exnention of `F=ma` where right hand side is d/dt of momentum.
