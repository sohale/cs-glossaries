## In the historical order of my journey in understanding it

### Level 1: Energy: E+V
Simply, kinetic plus potential energy.

As commonly used in high school physics

### Level 2: As used in Schrodinger Equation

### Level 3: Hamiltonian Everywhere: in Quantum Mechanics

### Level 4: Legendre transform on Lagrangian (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 5: Sampling: as an extension to MCMC

### Level 6: Simple 1st-order ODEs (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 7: Natural momentum (Extention to Lagrangian)
Emergence of Momentum.

Lagrangian assumes x-dot to be the momentum.

A natural extension of `F=ma` where right-hand side is d/dt of momentum.

How the "Natural momentum" view (paradigm) is related to the Noether theorem

( Quote: "The Noether theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws can be applied directly in a Hamiltonian framework without using any intermediate Lagrangian formulation")

### Level 8: Something volume of which
* is preserved
* is entropy
Its relation to natural-ness of phase-space.

A natural way of parametrising phase space (also see: "natural momentum")


## Questions never-ending

Questions that every time asked, bring a breath of freshness, don't cease to bring about new insights.

* How Hamiltonian is related to Legendre transform? (in both ways) (See math-ml/Legendre-transform.md)
* Relation to Partition function
* Is it scalar or vector? (Classical versus Quantum)
* Why phase-space preserves volume?
* Relation with Entropy
