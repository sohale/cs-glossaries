## In the historical order of my journey in understanding it

### Level 1: Energy: E+V
Simply, kinetic plus potential energy.

As commonly used in high school physics

### Level 2: As used in Schrodinger Equation

### Level 3: Hamiltonian Everywhere: in Quantum Mechanics

### Level 4: Legendre transform on Lagrangian (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 5: Sampling: as an extension to MCMC

### Level 6: Simple 1st-order ODEs (Extention to Lagrangian)

### Level 7: Natural momentum (Extention to Lagrangian)
Emergence of Momentum.

Lagrangian assumes x-dot to be the momentum.

A natural extension of `F=ma` where right-hand side is d/dt of momentum.

How the "Natural momentum" view (paradigm) is related to the Noether theorem

( Quote: "The Noether theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws can be applied directly in a Hamiltonian framework without using any intermediate Lagrangian formulation")

### Level 8: Something volume of which
* is preserved
* is entropy
Its relation to natural-ness of phase-space.

A natural way of parametrising phase space (also see: "natural momentum")

### Level 9: Liouville's theorem's route

Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian): (Quote: )
* "The phase-space distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system", "is constant with time".

* "the density of system points in the vicinity of a given system point travelling through phase-space", "is constant with time".

### Level 10: Is Action Integral more natural, or Hamiltonian?
or both are the same?

### Level 11: Hamiltonian emerges naturally in the Symplectic Group

Symplectic geometry (and Symplectic Group) "has its origins in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics"
where the phase space of certain classical systems takes on the structure of a "symplectic manifold".


## Many routes
* Symplectic
* Lagrangian story
* E+-V versus E+V story (action integral story)
* Hamiltonian as invariant


## Questions never-ending

Questions that every time asked, bring a breath of freshness, don't cease to bring about new insights.

* How Hamiltonian is related to Legendre transform? (in both ways) (See math-ml/Legendre-transform.md)
* Relation to Partition function
* Is it scalar or vector? (Classical versus Quantum)
* Why it preserve the volume in phase-space?
* Relation with Entropy
* Is Liouville's theorem necessary to bring about Hamiltonian from Lagrangian?
* Many paths: Symplectic
