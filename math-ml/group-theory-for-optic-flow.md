Group theory, but for context of Optic Flow

Group Theory is general, and I approached it from different angles. (Another one is Invariants in vision. Yes another, ... . Also I used to like Lie Algebras, but I don't know why.).

This one (this page) is about possible rotations (Galileo) in and Symplectic group.

Def: Algebra: means Group Theory and its extentions.

Definition: If is Manifold + is Group => is Lie Algebra.

**Refresentaiton theory** comes to picture. Now, just simply matrices.
