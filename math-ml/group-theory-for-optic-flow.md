Group theory, but for context of Optic Flow

Group Theory is general, and I approached it from different angles. (Another one is Invariants in vision. Yes another, ... . Also I used to like Lie Algebras, but I don't know why.).

This one (this page) is about possible rotations (Galileo) in and Symplectic group.

Def: Algebra: means Group Theory and its extentions.

Definition: If is Manifold + is Group => is Lie Algebra.

(These "Definitions" are not litral definnitions in Maths:
in my weak mind. Don't try to be correct objectively. I just reflec thwat I know. Now it's an object here, that I can gradually shape it here. But it is LTM. I can change it slowly, so that my LTM changes slowly. LTM-ness = Objec(ive)-ness).

**Representation theory** comes to picture. Now, just simply matrices.
