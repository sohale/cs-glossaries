[Almost] The title:
* Hebb

* STDP

(Neural) Learning s ooposed to eural coding.

The house of (
Master list of words-only):

* STDP learning
* Oja rule
* BCM theory
* ...
* Training
    * Back-propagation

Appraoches: (lines of people)
* Hebbian learning
   * Then anti-hebbian
* STDP
* Oja rule
* BCM theory
* Back propagation
* Contrastice leanring
* Info-theoretic leanring (Amari's ICA) and update rules
* NCE
* Spiking NN people
   * Surrogate Gradient
* PP/FEP (error signal, also: RL as PP) (maybe all RL?)
* RL
   * TD (temporal differnce RL)
   * Other types o RL
* Basically learning rule for any ML system!
