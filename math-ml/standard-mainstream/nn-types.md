nn-types:

good ideas (not good banchmark performances)


Features:
is control
* is cost-function (Also: variations? tranjectory? EulLagr?)
* Uses factorizing
* reduces error
* is generative
* PP's δ
* PP's weights
* recoder
* prob/Bayes
* $\partial/\partial$ derivative or difference
* ff/fb
* unified train/activit (eg Impicit)
* reward

Network name:
* `HelmH sleep`: HelmHoltz: sleep/wake cycle (Hinton)
* Backpropg + ReLU

Other features:
* Nash between parts (check difference between two modules): GAN
* Adding special module: reward
