Worked. See [raw1](https://github.com/sohale/gpu-experimentations/tree/8b273f26d6065ad90091982d26b5482002dda09a/experiments/raw1)
* AWS GPU
`nv*` Did not work

### Tuning Techniques for Inference
( Not MLOps )

#### Tuning Glossary
Some terminology used by Ivy, quantisation, (dynamic offloading?), XLA tuning, etc.
* Model router. Routing (Expert Routing, Custom Routing; see Ivy). "the model router"

#### pointers
Things/references to look at.
