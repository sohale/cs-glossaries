## MLOps
( Not performance tuning )
Servers, API, services, Cloud.

### Tensorflow MLOps
### Pytorch MLOps

### GPU Cloud
Lower-level

* Paperspaces + Terraform
Worked. See [https://github.com/sohale/gpu-experimentations/tree/8b273f26d6065ad90091982d26b5482002dda09a/experiments/raw1](raw1)
* AWS GPU
`nv*` Did not work

## Tuning

### Tuning Techniques for Inference
( Not MLOps )

Some terminology used by Ivy, quantisation, (dynamic offloading?), XLA tuning, etc.
