Extreme Learning Machines

### üóùÔ∏è facts
* Good generalisation
* Just uses Moore-Penrose Inverse

### standard facts
* By Guang-Bin Huang
* 2006 [^Huang2006]

### Key questions
(With existing concrete historical answers)
* What are the typical applications (and datasets) in which it worked and made people interested in it
* It was back in 2006, before many developments, is it still relevant?
* Why not back-propagate all the way?
* Common conditioning and variations? (Boosting, Bagging,
    * Common nonlinearities (RBFs)
* What makes people still interested in it?
* What made people excited back then?
    * Benhmarks compared it with what?
