# ELM

Extreme Learning Machines

### üóùÔ∏è facts
* Good generalisation
* Just uses Moore-Penrose Inverse

### standard facts
* By Guang-Bin Huang
* 2006 [^Huang2006]

### Key questions
(With existing concrete historical answers)
* What are the typical applications (and datasets) in which it worked and made people interested in it
* It was back in 2006, before many developments, is it still relevant?
* Why not back-propagate all the way?
* Common conditioning and variations? (Boosting, Bagging,
    * Common nonlinearities (RBFs)
* What makes people still interested in it?
* What made people excited back then?
    * Benhmarks compared it with what?
        * By (Huang 2006): BP, SVR and ELM [^Huang2006]

#### Some answers
* Benchmarked with
    * BP, SVR and ELM: [^Huang2006]
        * SVR: support vector machine for regression

    * Used it in Time Series analysis (multivariate stock price predictions) using CNN, RNN, LSTM and ELM. <!-- Machine Learning InternMachine Learning Intern.

Here in IIIT Guwahati,I have done a project on stock market analysis with a lot of indicators. Alongwith I have been exploring the area of time series analysis. I have built strong foundation in time series analysis iwith python and data Visualization and some other neural networks like CNN , RNN, LSTM and ELM(Extreme learning machines). -->
