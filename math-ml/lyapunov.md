# Lyapunov stability

## Some disambiguations
### "Lyapunov stability" versus "Lyapunov function"

## Scope: (What is Lyapunov not)
* We have a dynamical system
* The Lyapunov function is not known
* Is an engineering solution: You devise it: you find it. If it exists, then...
* It is a scalar function
* We have an equilibrium point. We know its existence, but also know it (know the x (vector/ point)'s value (coordinates) )

*
