# Expectaion Maximisation and Majorization Maximisation

Discusses:
* The EM algorithm (ways to describe it, ways to frame it, applications)
* The MM algorithm
* MM-like algorithms (variants)
* Hierarchy of MM-EM etc
* Relation to dual (convexity: FE, Lagrange Dual)

### Reading material
primary for me
* [Hunter & Lange](http://yaroslavvb.com/papers/hunter-tutorial.pdf)'s "A tutorial on MM algorithms"

### Maybe useful
From here and there
* [relationship between mm & em](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/44513/the-relationship-between-expectation-maximization-and-majorization-minimization)
* [Generalized Majorization-Minimization](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/parizi19a/parizi19a.pdf) by Sobhan Naderi, Kun He, Reza Aghajani, Stan Sclaroff, Pedro Felzenszwalb.
