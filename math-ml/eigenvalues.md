Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Here I collect insights on these.

### What I missed:
Lessons learned
* Can the (rotation) matrix be reproduced from eigen?
* In what sense complex vectors are not real?
* That point about symmetric matrices
* 
### Open:
Not sure what is missing
* ...
* Why sth is multiplied on two sides?

### Also see
* [eigenvalues](eigenvalues.md) (this)
* [Lagrange multipliers](./lagrange-multipliers.md)
* [Nonlinear Optimisation methods with constraints](./nlo.md)
