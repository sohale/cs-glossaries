#### ISI names (exactly the same meaning)
* Interarrival Time
* Inter-Occurrence Time
* Inter-Event Time: IET
* Inter-Spike Interval: ISI
* Waiting Time
* Recurrence Time
* Renewal Interval
* Inter-renewal Time
* Gap Time
* Dwell Time
* Interarrival Time

Terms for ISI with Slightly different meanings:

* Subtypes: ("time until ...")
   * first-passage time
   * Event Time (or: a "Not from an event" from `0` in a global clock)
   * Rescaled ... ISI (!)
   * Not from an event:
      * Censored Time
      * Time-to-Event
      * Failure Time (`Sa`)
   * Alternating:
      * Uptime & Downtime
      * Time-to-Failure (`MTTF`)
      * Repair Time (`MFFT`)
      * Episode Duration
      * Latency Period
      * Idle Time
      * Cycle Time
      * Elapsed Time
      * Failure Time
      * Service Time (`QT`)
      * System Availability: SA (`SA`)
   * Latencies:
      * Time-to-Detection
   * Misc: (not ISI at all)
      * Waiting Time -- (`QT`)
      * Sojourn Time (`QT`)
      * Time-to-Hazard (`Cox`)
   * Further
      * Residence Time (the period that a substance remains in a particular part of a system)

In contexts (Mathematical):
* Renewal Theory
* survival analysis (`Sa`)
* reliability theory
* `QT`: Queue Theory
* Specific application domain contexts
   * `Cox`: Cox model: "Hazard", Cox Proportional Hazards Model, (Risk models?)
   * particle interactions
   * molecular dynamics
   * climate studies
   * geophysical processes
   * `MFFT`: Fault Tolerance, Defect, "Repain", MFFT, MTTR
   * `SA`: System Availability in Cloud Platforms
