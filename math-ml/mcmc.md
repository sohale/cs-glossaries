# MCMC

MCMC = Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Evolution:
Metropolis et al (1953) â†’ Green (1995)

* "Monte Carlo"
* "Metropolis" algorithm
* "Metropolis--Hastings" algorithm
* "Metropolis--Hastings--Green" algorithm

Timeline:
* "Monte Carlo"
* Metropolis et al (1953)
* Hastings (1970)
* Geman & Geman (1984)
* Green (1995)

Timeline: (with details)
* "Monte Carlo" -- simulations
* Metropolis et al (1953) -- Los Alamos (physics): simulating liquid-gas equilibrium. Chemists & Phsicits for simlulation
* Hastings (1970) -- generalised
* Various (slow catch up, despite Hastings)
   * Geman & Geman (1984) --  ( as "Gibbs sampler") (a special case of "Hastings" ! ) (focus on optimisation: finding the posteriors's "mode")
   * (various): "Gibbs sampler simulated the posterior distribution" -> enables "full Bayesian inference of all kinds"
   * called "data augmentation" (Tanner, Wong 1987)
   * popularised to whole statistics (Bayesian community) (not just spatial) by (Gelfand & Smith 1990)
   * "Bayesian Inference" can be done by "MCMC"
   * Took a while to fully understand MCMC's theory.
* Green (1995) -- "Metropolis--Hastings--Green" algorithm: Generalised it as much as it can be generalised!
