History: (based on page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics))

* 1781: Monge
* 1942: Kantorovich
* Hitchcock problem (1941)
* the Wasserstein metric $W_p$

<!-- optimal transportation and allocation of resources.-->
Formalized by Gaspard Monge in 1781. Later, by Leonid Kantorovich in (1942?).

Led to Monge–Kantorovich transportation problem. The "Kantorovich problem".
The Hitchcock–Koopmans transportation (linear programming formulation of the transportation problem).
Hitchcock problem (1941).
Tjalling Koopmans ( transport economics , allocation of resources).
