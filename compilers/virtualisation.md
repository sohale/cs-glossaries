To solve confusion about vagrant and other virtualisation tools and their difference.

What is `vagrant` and what it is not?

* How vagrant versus qemu are different?
* What about those hardware facilities for emulation?

## Virtualisation and Emulation Softwares
### vagrant

Vagrant by HashiCorp

### qemu
* QEMU was before vagrant
* QEMU is for full-system emulation

### Other: Tools
### Other: GPU Emulation
simGPUGPU
### Other: GPU containeralisaiton/Virtualisation

### Other: Softwares Products
* VMWare
* VirtualBox

* Linux-V server is an operating system-level virtualization

## VM Conceptology
### VM: Levels
(See deplendency/stack)
* Software product (full system): VMware, VirtualBox
* docker sub: marketplace
* docker: product (more than a CLI)
* tools: CLI tools: Vagrant
* backend
* KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
* (library): e.g. `Libvirt`
* NS (OS-level: Linux)
* CPU facilities (instructions)

where to put this in above stack?
* "Hyper-V"
* "container hypervisor" (LXD, by Canonical)
    * "virtual machine"-like experience with "containers".

"virtual machine" versus "container"

"virtual machine"-like versus "virtual machine"


Container versus Namespace?

LXD versus LXC

"container hypervisor" built on LXC

"virtual machine" verus Emulator

LXD versus Docker: scopes/focuses (API, CLI/UI, Volume, images)

From Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/): "enable Hyper-V and Containers"

#### Ways to say it:
* "Virtualisation with QEMU"
* QEMU type is: Hypervisor, Emulator

### VM: Terminology: Related
* **provision**: "QEMU can be used as a backend for Vagrant to provision virtual machines"
* **Ring** (See intel assembly)
* **Ring 0**
* Container Engine
* Infrastructure (context: [Lambda](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/virtual-machines/))
* "Host Hardware Platform"
* VM Type in terms of optimisaiotn: Compute-optimised, memory-optimised, storage-, GPU-, high-performance computer-*
* Virtual Network
* VM Monitor
* "Physical Machine" (when you want to ...)
   * Industrial PC
   * Rack
* "VM Control"
* "Virtual Environment"

   * Monolithic Kernel
   * Microkernel
   * Semi-Microkernel
   * Exokernel
   * Kernel Bypassing (Direct-Access Library for Certain Subsystems)
   * Disaggregated Kernel
* Minor relevance:
   * VPS (also see: "Virtual Network")
   * Host OS
* The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as part of Linux Foundaiton

    * Borg (cluster manager) -- intrernally used in G since 2008

### VM: Dependency:
Dependency struture:

QEMU can be used as a backend for Vagrant to provision virtual machines"

#### Underlying technology
Virualisaiotn underlying technology in open-source software may rely on (typically):
* QEMU (Emulation)
* Linux (OS: NS or/and CG)
* Processor (hardware) facilities for virtualisation

#### Technology that use vitualisiton
(Overlying) technology that use virtualiziton
* Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
* Cluster manager
* VPS and Cloud

#### Clear (logical) separation of layers
* Clear logical separation of layers:
    * ‚ñ¢ Cluster manager or Cloud
    * ‚ñ¢ Virtualizaiton Manager / Provider . (VM-system) (a VPS system, multiple instances, is here, since it needs to create and remove VMs+netw/resources) (CLuster management may have overlaps, but has more than this) (`dockerd` is here)
    * ‚ñ¢ ? Contrainer (with resources: space; may share or has own resources; network?) (A VPS instance is this). A docker container is here (more than a raw VM).
    * ‚ñ¢ Virtualizaiton (as an abstraction layer) (raw VM)
        * Itself may be in OS, or has underlyling OS, nested, etc, even may be separate dedicated hardware, but in VM capacity.
        * Nothing lower than VM. If a VM-system (docker, etc) is run nested inside a VM, that's a differnt story.

### Versus-ology: ns, cg, vm
cgroups vs Namespaces:
* cgroups: Control and limit resource usage
* ns: Isolate system resources.

#### Linux LXC timeline
* 2002: Linux Namespaces began (Eric W. Biederman) [[4]](#4) and [...]
* 2006: Cgroups Introduced (Google engineers Paul Menage and Rohit Seth)
* 2008: Namespaces and Cgroups in Linux Kernel
* 2008: First Release of LXC
* 2010‚Äì2012: Early Adoption
* 2013: Linux NS completed (kernel 3.8) adepquate for "containers"; "User namespaces" [[5]](#5) (Kernel 3.8 released on 18 Feb 2013)

#### Linux Namespaces timeline

* 2002: `mnt`: "Mount" namespaces (Linux) (kernel 2.4.19)
    * `uts` (for hostname and NIS) [[6]](#6)
* 2013: `user`: "User" namespaces (Linux) (kernel 3.8)
     * considered completed: adepquate for "containers"
* 2015: The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) was formed (for Kubernetes)
* 2016: `cgroup` namespace: Control group (kernel 4.6) -- isolates the view of the "cgroup hierarchy"
     * adepquate for Kubernetes
* Proposed:
   * journal namespace
   * syslog namespace

Linux (kernel 5.6) has 8 kinds of namespaces:
Mount,
Process ID,
Network,
Inter-process Communication,
Unix Time-Sharing,
User ID,
Control group,
Time
(`mnt`, `pid`, `net`, `ipc`, `uts`, `user`, `cgroup`, `time`).

* Mount (mnt)
* Process ID (pid)
* Network (net)
* Inter-process Communication (ipc)
* Unix Time-Sharing (uts)
* User ID (user)
* Control group (cgroup)
* Time

Linux syscalls: (see [[4]](#4))
* `clone`
* `unshare`
* `setns`

They are:
* (Why specified by FD?)
* Uniquely specified by `pid/ns/nskind`
* Are garbage collected
* Accessed via `/proc/<pid>/ns/<nskind>`

### Misc
* journal namespace
* syslog namespace
