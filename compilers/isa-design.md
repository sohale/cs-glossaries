# ISA design

I have being doing ISA Design as part of my aspirations for (C)PU design around age 12-13.

Some of the ideas were simlar to RISC (I was already familiar with CISC ISA via normal x86 assembly, 8502 assembly, 68000 assembly, Z80 asembly ).

Some terms:

* VLIW: Very long instruction word
* Code Morphing (Transmeta)
* Itanium – Family of 64-bit Intel microprocessors
* MIPS
* Transmeta
* RISC (versus CISC)
* No instruction set computing
* One-instruction set computer – Abstract machine that uses only one instruction
* Complex instruction set computer – Processor with instructions capable of multi-step operations
* Explicitly parallel instruction computing – Instruction set architecture
* Minimal instruction set computer – CPU architecture
* Reduced instruction set computer – Processor executing one instruction in minimal clock cycles
* Elbrus (computer) – Line of Soviet and Russian computer systems
* Movidius – American computer processor chip design company
* Single instruction, multiple data – Type of parallel processing
* Single instruction, multiple threads – Execution model used in parallel computing
* Transport triggered architecture – Type of computer processor design
* TM as ISA

* Experimental: YASEP MCU, F-CPU, FC0, FC1
