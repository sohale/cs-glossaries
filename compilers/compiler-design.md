Compiler concepts revision in the style of Q/A

Like many concepts, it's also a vocabulary:
* Binary Decision Diagrams
* to postdominate
* to dominate
* code motion
* linear analysis

Some techniques:
* "Loop Unrolling" is a technique for what?

* "Region-Based Scheduling" is a technique for what?

Some questions:
* Why Interprocedural Analysis?
* Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
* Time-Partition Constraints
* Array Contraction
* Uses of Affine Transforms
* Why Instruction-Level Parallelism
* What is Basic-Block Scheduling
* What is Topological Orders
* What is List Scheduling of Basic Blocks
* What is Prioritized Topological Orders
* What does it mean "List scheduling does not backtrack"
* What are the issues of Global Code Scheduling
* What is Primitive Code Motion
* What is Upward Code Motion
* What is Downward Code Motion
* In what context (and why) is Updating Data Dependences a concern?

* What is linear analysis?
* 
 
Name:
* Some Locality Optimizations techniques
