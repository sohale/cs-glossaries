# Numerical & Neural Networks Performance Frameworks and libraries

Libraries and Frameworks that enhance numerical programming in specific or general purpose (mostlymatrices) or special purposes (Neural Networks & AI) for CPU, GPU, xPU (NPU, TPU, DPU), various specific or gneral architectures, and usually centered around linear algebra and matrix computing, and probabilistic programming
