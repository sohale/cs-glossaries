# Numerical & Neural Networks Performance Frameworks and libraries

Libraries and Frameworks that enhance numerical programming in specific or general purpose (mostlymatrices) or special purposes (Neural Networks & AI) for CPU, GPU, xPU (NPU, TPU, DPU), various specific or gneral architectures, and usually centered around linear algebra and matrix computing, and probabilistic programming

Key example: JAX

Key aspects:
* dependency (repliance), timeline, company
Key questions:
* What relies on what (Tensorflow is an engine? or does it reply on ...)
* OpenVINO has been around?
    * Their Timeline
    * Surprises about old packages keep happening: VTM, OpenVINO are surprisingly old
