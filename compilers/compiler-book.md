Compulers at age of AI, AV & ML


### Preface
While looking from fantastic shoulder of giants, in the new era,
in 2024, we need a new Compiler Design text book that is more about 2024 than 1986,
and is able to get students up to working know-how as well as an academic vision for the new era.

All of these appeared after 2006:
LLVM, MLIR
Rust, Zig, Jai, Hare, Odin, Modular Mojo, C++23, and even GoLang.
Large Language Models, transformers, deep learning.
Devops, infrastructure as code.
Small Language Modesls and NN-insired compilers.
Heterogeneous computing and heterogenious cloud.
multi-cloud, hybrid cloud (heterogeneous)
Itanium died a thousand deaths [ref].

More modern approaches to concurrent.

C++20 is not aught up.
Javascript ...
Docker.
