(with a personal coment)

## Concepts
### The concept of "Resource"

What does it meaan "Resrouce"ness (versus protocol):

* Consider APIs as an access bus or interface or "protocol", not encompassing, but separting the resources.
Resource means "on the other side".

* Resource is beyond the API (protocol).

* Resource is (all of) the stateful parts.
The protocol is the staateless part.

* Protocol is a pipe.. (reversible? becauase it is stateless).
