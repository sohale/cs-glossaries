## Concepts
### Concept of resource


* Consider APIs as an access bus or interface or "protocol", not encompassing, but separting the resources.
Resource means "on the other side".

* Resource is beyond the API (protocol).

* Resource is (all of) the stateful parts.
The protocol is the staateless part.

* Protocol is a pipe.. (reversible? becauase it is stateless).
