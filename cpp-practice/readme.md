## C++20 code practice

C++20 feature exploration
and C++20 practice

Since it's C++20, this folder is for C++20. In case of future C++ releases, the related code will be added here.

This is just a stash of C++ code, scripts to compile, etc. Not a lookup doocumentation for the purpuse of future reference.
It is more about doing/writing the code, not reading.
However, it is alswo useful for refreshing mmind about the concepts and syntax.
