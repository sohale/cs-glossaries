## C++20 code practice

C++20 feature exploration
and C++20 practÿ®ice

Since it's C++20, this folder is for C++20. In case of future C++ releases, the related code will be added here.

This is just a stash of C++ code, scripts to compile, etc. Not a lookup doocumentation for the purpuse of future reference.
It is more about doing/writing the code, not reading.
However, it is alswo useful for refreshing mmind about the concepts and syntax.

Keep these siolated from the rest of the repo.

The focus (mental investment/attention/priority) will be on [C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20).


### Specific questions:

* `template` parameters that are `typedef` versus value or non-`typedef`.
   *  i.e. "type parameter" and "nno-type parameter" vs "template-parameter"s.
   * (Code to be written)

* C++20 concepts: types of name `X auto`. That's it.
   * (Code to be written)
