# Category Theory:

## Category Theory and some applicaitons in computer science and logic:
Category Theory the way I understood it.

Defining Category itself:
* A "category" is a specific mathematical structure, [ϒ] itself, a mathemaical object.
* Is comprised of objects (free mathematical objects) and morophisms between them.
* A category is a specific mathematical structure, [ϒ] itself, a mathemaical object.
* Leave certain things free, but certain things are tight.
* It is very vast: may not fit (ϛ) in a set.
    * (its set/class of objects) may transcend sets.
* The objects can be anything.
    * Each is one object? in one form? or multiple.
    * May transcend sets.

* Not everything is a category. What is not a category: (non-trivial ones):
    * a Cat²
        * is somewhat richer than a category

Category theory, there are nice compact-elegrant-simple notations.
* Uderline category to distinguish from its objects.
* 3-letter names:
   * obj
   * cat,Cat,etc
   * 3-letter catgories
      * Set
      * Prop
      * ...
* more to come.

Legend:
* **û** or **ϒ** : my unique perspective that you cannot find somewhere else.
*  **ϛ** ϛ : TOuch or sense or haptic experience
