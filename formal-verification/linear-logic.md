Motivations:
* Classical Logic Fails to Model Resource Usage
* linear logic enables controlled use of side effects, without abandoning purity (The Curry–Howard Correspondence with State)
* the Game-Theoretic view or Process View to LL
* LL linear logic mirrors the conservation laws (akin to Modeling Physical or Biological Systems)
* LL allows Seeing the Fine Structure in Proof Theory or Type Theory.

to mince:

linear logic reveals the algebraic structure underlying reasoning, making it possible to track transformations like algebraic rewrites, program execution, or communication flows.
.


linear types can encode safe mutation, IO, and concurrency while preserving strong guarantees.

Rust type system has linear traits—ownership and borrowing.


Curry–Howard isomorphism:

Side note:
Functional programming (and by extension, the Curry–Howard isomorphism).
