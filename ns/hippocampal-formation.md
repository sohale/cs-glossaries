Memory is ephemeral.
Things you learn but you firget.
This is about things that you have learned (at ITM level: xTM = certain type of convergence and integration . Convergence = capsuleNN-like)
Books snd dour es are the ones I already read and learned.
It is offliading contents of my mind, rather than readings.

Reading part: 1. is the sources that I decided to keep in memory to read them.
2. Sources that I already have spend intimate-learning-time reading them.

But this condolidates them only. LLTM. (Post-LTM).

So that I can revise (to remember) later. Interviews etc. things that I already knew but cannot answer. Because were lost. And hance, m**rn.

These are not mine. Can be shared. Like a tutorial etc. Sicially oresented as: the way I understood xyz.
