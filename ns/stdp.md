### Intentions
* Initial intention: STDP, Gerstner's approach (Espcially given the extention to his approach)
* Intention 2: Specific formulations:
non-negative, stability, STDP, BCN, etc as they know it. The way formulated by mainstream.
What are considered equivalent? What are the open problems (stability etc). What is not equivalent to . What is not back-propagation?
Coincidence-detection and correlation finding. (Hinton's stack as correlations).

## Gerstner's approach
Gerstner's approach to STDP using extentions on SRMs

* The Scholarpedia [page](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity) on STDP

## Standard Hebbian

### Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) "rule"
Why "rule"?
* again, [scholarpedia: BCM](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity#STDP_and_Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro_.28BCM.29_rule)
* [BCM theory](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/BCM_theory) (separate article) on Scholarpedia
* Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro 1982

* A Generalisation of BCM: by Clopath: "A triplet spike-timing-dependent plasticity model generalizes the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule to higher-order spatiotemporal correlations"

### Ways to put it:
* Learning  (seeing it as learning)
* Plasticity (plasticity: on van Russom's page)
* Correlation and Coincidence detction
* Functional connectivity (?)
* Matrix (non-positive)
* LTP/LTD
* Memory (seeing it as "memory". or LTM. vs ITM.)
