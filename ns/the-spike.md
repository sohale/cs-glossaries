## The biochemistry of Action Potential

The spike: Action potential, ions, channels, terms, currents.

Na, K, current flows and their directions, electrical field (physically accurate), LFP, etc.

* Net transmembrane current (at each point) (compare to net voltage, net electrical field, etc)
* flows of several different ion types through the membranes
* electrical currents are generally classified into passive and active currents
   * passive currents
   * active currrents (probably won't conribute to LFP; see LFP)
* Electrical Current sink & source (net charge)
   * Electrical Current sink
   * Electrical Current source
   * sink–source pairs of current (net is zero, often paired)
* has spatial pattern, has net charge (patches of electrical currents)
    * point-wise current sources or current sinks (for modelling)

## Continuous
### LFP
LFP multiple definitions:
* Operational definition of LFP:
    * decomposition: LFP + MUA (under-determined)
        * What is MUA?
        * MUA: direct contribution of spikes. Direct = Electrical Field?
        * Spurious: Zanos et al. 2011, Pesaran et al., 2002 [1]
    * low-pass filtering
* Physical definition
* LFP in terms of CSD:
   * CSD
* Input-output: MUA vs LFP

* CSD better localise sink-sources

Neural activity contributing to LFP: (different types of events of neuronal activity)
* Spikes
* Bursts
* Synaptic activity
   * (synaptic and axonal events are opposite)
   * arrival and the generation of the spikes
   * synapses receive spike while no spike is created
   * The influence of the synaptic events is often stronger (dominant) than the effect of action potentials on LFP. (Integration?) (Leak: slow envelope?)
   * depends on
       * position of the synaptic input on the dendrite,
       * morphology of the neurons
       * 
* Calcium Spikes
* (unsure) AHP
* also:
   * Passive currents verys activ currents

* local neuronal processes (in fact: flows? )

* Entanlged: correlation in the synaptic activity
   * coordinated circuit activity
   * shared inputs
   * ... (circuit)

(spatial selectivity)

(correlations of the LFP signals.)

Time code: [3]
* relative timing
* temporal patterns

## Continuous signals
* EEG, (ERP, QEEG), ECoG, EMG, MEG, (f)MRI (BOLD), Other imagine: SPECT, PET.
* LFP, LFP filtered, LFP phase (Hilbert)
* MUA, SUA
* Intracellular (patch clamp)
    * see: Fancy-clamps (Dynamic clamp, etc)
* Calcium spike
* Clacium: Voltage-Sensitive Dyes ([VSD](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Voltage-sensitive_dye))
* Optogenic
* Non-response: Confocal microscope, double-photon ([activity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20230/)), Two-photon excitation microscopy ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_excitation_microscopy)) / two-photon imaging.
* [Microdialysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdialysis)
* Electrophysiology: Electrode, tetrode, electrode array, etc
