## The biochemistry of Action Potential

The spike: Action potential, ions, channels, terms, currents.

Na, K, current flows and their directions, electrical field (physically accurate), LFP, etc.

* Net transmembrane current (at each point) (compare to net voltage, net electrical field, etc)
* flows of several different ion types through the membranes
* electrical currents are generally classified into passive and active currents
   * passive currents
   * active currrents (probably won't conribute to LFP; see LFP)
* Current sink (not charge?)
* Current source

### LFP
LFP multiple definitions:
* Operational definition of LFP:
    * decomposition: LFP + MUA (under-determined)
        * What is MUA?
        * MUA: direct contribution of spikes. Direct = Electrical Field?
        * Spurious: Zanos et al. 2011, Pesaran et al., 2002 [1]
    * low-pass filtering
* Physical definition
* LFP in terms of CSD:
   * CSD

Neural activity contributing to LFP:
* Spikes
* Bursts
* Synaptic activity
* Calcium Spikes
* (unsure) AHP
* also:
   * Passive currents verys activ currents
