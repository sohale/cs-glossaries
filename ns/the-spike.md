## The biochemistry of Action Potential

The spike: Action potential, ions, channels, terms, currents.

Na, K, current flows and their directions, electrical field (physically accurate), LFP, etc.

* flows of several different ion types through the membranes
* electrical currents are generally classified into passive and active currents
   * passive currents
   * active currrents (probably wont conribute to LFP)

LFP multiple definitions:
* Operational definition of LFP:
    * decomposition: LFP + MUA (under-determined)
        * What is MUA (direct contribution of spikes). Direct = Electrical Field?
    * low-pass filtering
* Physical definition
* LFP in terms of CSD:
   * CSD
