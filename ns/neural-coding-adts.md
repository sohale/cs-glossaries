A cute (toy-like) document about various ways Neural Coding helps compuation:

Genius ideas designed by nature/evolution that makes our hard problems easier and tractable. In the sense of ADTs.

### Insect circuits Spatial Integration of location (Webb)
### LMC encoding for c e (Hadi)
### Time of first-spike coding (Thorpe)
### (Event-based) y-discritisation coding (Panzeri's collaborator)
### Phase coding of location? (How does it help?)
### Phase coding for bursts (Montemurro)
### Clasical Pouget Population coding
### Clasical Zhang Population coding
Used for head direction, etc
### (Machens)
Machens clash of threshold: mask away
### Adrian and Integrate and Fire
### (classic ANN:) simple thresholds
#### (classic ANN:) tanh
#### (classic ANN:) ReLU
### Future
* Limbic-PFC interactions (mask logic)
* Disinhibition in BG
* VTA encodes prediction error of value (acuumulating reward)
* RNN, replay: episodic
