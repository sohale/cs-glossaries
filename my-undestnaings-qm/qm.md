# Quantum Mechanics
My QM book.

(My) intro to Quantum Mechanics:

Chapter 1: Pre-M conceptualisations.

How I charaacterise (intention/telos/reason-for-existeence/apriori-essense) this book:
* The way I see it.
* With my own confusions.
* This is my substitute long-term-memory (extended mind, a mind helper).

### I usually confuse:
Or recur.

* Hermician and unitary matrices
* Block sphere and Pauli matrices
* L.A: Unitary, Real, etc Matrices.

### (uncategorised)
Highlights:
* Hermician matrices associate with observables.


#### Hermician matrices
Each observable is a [Hermitian] matrix. Since most times Hermitian matrices don't [commute], obervables don't commute. Then uncertinty in derived* from this. (I say derived, that is, I try to avoid to sya that objevctiveerly-results from it).

Properties: [x][1]
* Equality with the adjoint (conjugate transpose)
* unitarily diagonalizable
* real eigenvalues

And of course:
* is square
* diagonal elements must be real

A bit confusing:
* Every Hermitian matrix is a [normal matrix].
* `A` `A^H`=`A` `A`=`A^H`
* can be diagonalized by a [unitary matrix]
(based on finite-dimensional [spectral theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem#Hermitian_maps_and_Hermitian_matrices))

## Chapter 2: New approach: Post-M conceptualisation

#### The feels analysis

The three feels:
* State (normalised) (info): ψ (vector)
    * probability-amplitude ( one element)
    * base vectors in this ( info y?)
* Observable Operator: physical: H (matrix)
    * Time-Evolution operator is also observanle!
    * base vectors in this: ...
* Norm^2 of ψ: Probability
* Measures ( dice ): usually scalar, can be discrete, finite
