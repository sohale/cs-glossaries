# Spin
Mathematics of Spin

Let's understand "spin" as a Mathematical concept.

The goal is to be able to compute and link to Quantum States, and Qubits.

The approach is Representation Theory.

Optional:
* Extend to other types of spin (non 1/2).
* Extention to Qubit: qutrit, quNit, qudits.

### Keywords to cover:
Spin, Qubit, Bloch Sphere, Pauli Matrices, Mixed States, Equatorial States, Phase-covariant

## Let's spin 💫

Let's start elementary.

𒎓
Let's aim at Mathematically representing the *state* of an *Electron*'s spin.
An electron is a spin-1/2 particle.

Assume spin is a magical state, un-this-world-ly.
Free yourself from any conception of, or intuition you have about "spin". Mechanical spin, or Quantum spin. Or electricity ⚡, or atoms ⚛️, orbitals.
Also forget "up"↑ or "down"↓ states, superposition, etc.

We can define spin as a set, which can be parametrised in different ways.



### Pure spin
Pure versus non-pure spin.

Pure spin, or isolated spin.
#### Real/Euclidean intuition

For now, we do it using real numbers (in other words, we parametrise, or characterise in Euclidean geometry: this helps to have a geometrical intuition too).

Two numbers:
(θ,ϕ)
but
`θ ∈ [ 0, π ]`
`ϕ ∈ [ 0, 2π )`

In other words: `S = { (θ,ϕ) ∣ ℝ²:  0 ≤θ≤ π , 0 ≤ϕ< 2π  }`

θ: مدار, ϕ: نصف النهار.

We have the surface of a sphere.
Phase is "abstracted away".
(later: where is the phase 🌈)

Geography of Bloch sphere 🌍🌐:
* The "Equatorial States" on 🌐: `θ = π/2`

Confusions: Where is the phase🌈? Sphere vs Spin, any related? Block sphere? Why ℂ² vs ℝ²? Why are they obsessed with complex numbers and phase🌈? Is it a "mixed state"? Where is the entanglement if there are more than one? Why the half (½)?

Multiple, apparently not compatible: ℂ² (4 numbers), ℝ² (2 numbers), sphere (Bloch), Pauli matrices (3 numbers), mixed state, ket ∣·⟩ (tensor), ∣·⟩⟨·∣ ket-bra (mixed) state (matrix), "Qubit". Orbitals (atom/chemistry and light spectrum).
Operators (difficult to reconcile with Euclidean 🌐).

#### Dynamical intuition

#### Group intuition
SU(2)

#### Let's complex
x ∈ ℂ² can be imagined as 4 numbers.
It can represent the state of an electron's spin.
a spin-1/2 particle.


#### What the fuss?
Pauli's belt. ɬ

#### What the phase?
