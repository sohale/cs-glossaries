# Spin
Mathematics of Spin

Let's understand "spin" as a Mathematical concept.

The goal is to be able to compute and link to Quantum States, and Qubits.

The approach is Representation Theory.

Optional:
* Extend to other types of spin (non 1/2).
* Extention to Qubit: qutrit, quNit, qudits.

### Keywords to cover:
Spin, Qubit, Bloch Sphere, Pauli Matrices, Mixed States, Equatorial States, Phase-covariant


## Let's spin

Let's start elementary.

Assume spin is a magical state, un-this-world-ly.
Free yourself from any conception of, or intuition you have about "spin".

We can define spin as a set, which can be parametrised in different ways.

Real/Euclidean intuition

For now, we do it using real numbers (in other words, we parametrise, or characterise in Eucleadean geometry: this helps to have a geometrical intuition too).

Dynamical intuition


#### Let's complex
x ∈ ℂ² can be imagined as 4 numbers.
It can represent the state of an electron's spin.



#### What the fuss?
Pauli's belt.

#### What the phase?
