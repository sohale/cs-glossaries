# Spin
MAthmatics of Spin

Let's understand "spin" as a Mathematical concept.

The goal is to be able to compute and link to Quantum States, and Qubits.

The approach is Representation Theory.

Optional: Extend to other types of spin (non 1/2).

### Keywords to cover:
Spin, Qubit (qutrit, quNit, qudits), Bloch Sphere, Pauli Matrices, Mixed States, Equatorial States, Phase-covariant
