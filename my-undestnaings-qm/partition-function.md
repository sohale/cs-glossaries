# Partition Functions
Why is **partition function** (PF) considered so special?
I remember many things were derived from it.
(Even Entropy?)

It is also normalisation in probability (it's my understanding):
Normalisation factor, for a non-normalisaed probablity function (water levels around an object).

    Pr(x) = f(x) / Z(θ)
    Z = s f(x) dx

or

    Pr(x;θ) = f(x;θ) / Z(θ)
    Z(;θ) = ∫ f(x;θ) dx

where `f(x)` is any positive function!

## Motivation
Motivation (properties that are motivations): (brief list)
* Renormalisation is when the derivatives of PF w.r.t ?? variables are infinity.
* Probability in terms of PF
* Entropy in terms of PF

## Related definitions
* "Thermodynamic state" "variables"
    * e.g. temperature, volume
