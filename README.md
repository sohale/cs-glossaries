# C++ glossary
Over the years, a precise vocabulary is built around C++ by the C++ community e.g. Bjarne Stroustrup. A glossary of C++ terms. A glossary of C++ terms. A mor rigorous version of Stroustrup's [glossary](http://www.stroustrup.com/glossary.html) [G]. The current document is orthogonal to the aforementioned glossary. These are the terms that are used almost in the identical form.

# Terms

###Uniform
Uniform and universal are the 4th alternative of initialisation.
###Universal

###Resource acquisition is initialization
(RAII)

### copy construction

###RAII
See Resource acquisition is initialization

### initializer list
See initializer_list

###  literal collection

### stack unwinding

## General or broad
* the initialization syntax
* exception safety
* exception-safe resource management
* Constructor Acquires, Destructor Releases'' (CADRe) see RAII
* Scope-based Resource Management'' (SBRM) see RAII


## Basic
* the C++ standard library
* smart pointers
* heap objects
* C++11
* C++14
* C++1y
* C-style cast
* new-style cast
* "explicit type conversion"
* pure virtual function

## Phrases
Example phrases
* RAII (stack-based) object
* object is released
* RAII is therefore highly recommended in C++
* the "resource acquisition is initialization" technique
* to manage all heap objects
* C-style cast is a dangerous form of explicit type conversion; prefer new-style cast [G]

## Quotations
* there are far more resource acquisitions than kinds of resources
