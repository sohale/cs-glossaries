# cpp-glossary
A glossary of C++ terms

and more (Python, JavaScript, async, etc)


* Things that I know. Or once knew. Or once implemented.

   * Patterns I found and don't want to throw them.
   * But also To accumulate them and organise them along each other (like a (cognitive-)map with coordinates (IND-axes): place-"mand")
* Sometimes can be seen also as narrow context tutorials (instead of an article in medium)
* kode-killing: Code that I am killing that (code-sink). (aka dev-notes, etc)

* Things that I keep need to rediscover. Gtest patterns that I liked, kind of worked, etc. (Also overlap with https://github.com/sohale/hemi-glossaries-public )

* Helps me channel the personal comments from my learning.

* Note: The contents put here have not IP issues. Reveals no information about the context of what I am working on.
  
* A know-how that I inherit for my future self: future in the sense of the gap between me and myself in terms of time-corrotion.
* It also may have a potential for socially expressing it. People may end up here and read something. (This adds a miniscule motivation to tidy up and organise).
  
Three types of articles:
   * The ref versus non-ref articles: "ref" are the sources I found. I don't necessarily know all the contents. (not hands-on knowledge). But everything here is about things I actually tried. Even finding the refs is the knowledge that I gained by trying.
   * Even this is a kind of achievement: I finally found a good source. and I want to protect it against loss and corrosion by time.
   * notes, tutorials, etc (main type)
   * Gathering disperse (survey of parts of concurrency I actually touched)

* Also as a LTM. (This can be the main definition of these). This is an extended LTM (meta- Long Term Memory: in the context of an extended mind)
   * The contents are not original
* Also as something I am teaching (to self, others, etc. These could be tutorials, articles. In social LTM~: not only decentralised + also in-the-flow-only: RNN: "Recurrent-time" storage)

* Trying  to remember many things I have done in the past and have not connected them, or their memory-distance is so far apart that are not integrated (zMQ in python, versus some concurrent  or distributed code)

* Discovery: Har-earned discoveries. THings that you come-by once-a-lifetime that can improve things. (See the `ref` style)

* This repo kind of reflects (and consolidates) the expertise that I am gaining. (If I put everything down, which currently happens at 0.001% ).
* But it is a "subset" of that. Of that Type (Category). "Subset" in that sense.
