/*
    A priority_queue does not need a separate field for the value (key) used for sorting. A brilliant way of abstracting: pop_back() returns the largest.
    What is it all about?
    ''its first element is always the greatest of the elements it contains, according to some strict weak ordering criterion``
    Common use:
    Internal: ?
    You cannot iterate elements.
    related: heap.
