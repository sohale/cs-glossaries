# On C++
A set of slides for introducing C++ in a show & tell

I forgot the original intentiono 
* Problems with C++ and why it's difficult
* What is C++ advanced about? It's about writing libraries
    * "Why" it tuyrned out to be difficult (even for JM who has done C++ in 90s, or me in 80s)
    * In what ways (examples of difficulties)
    * (Will crash)
* Quizes (in demo: for showing we don't know C++)

New:
* A section: Why we need to switch to Rust
* pros & cons in end
